the edge of your seat. Optimized for mobile users, this extreme fighter game is ripe with challenges. Walk around this 3D pixel world and confront deadly enemies all while collection an assortment of sophisticated, modern day weapons, ammo and health. Bring down your wrath in an amazing mission with varied enemies. Become the last line of defense in a sci-fi world of epic proportions. Enemies are everywhere and you must defeat every last one in order to claim the title as ultimate victor. \r\n\r\n??Time is running out...??\r\n\r\nI am a prisoner on a planet in a galaxy devoid of human life. I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed. In order to do battle, you must locate and equip a weapon. A selection of melee and firearm weapons exist across the maps. Your entity map will be a valuable asset as it allows you an aerial view of oncoming enemies so you can be prepared to strike. Collect health and ammo perks while you can, for these pickups will decrease as the levels progress making your mission all the more challenging. Let your surroundings aid your quest. Exploding barrels can be found and utilized to strategically take down enemies. Enjoy non-stop FPS action with endless battles and treacherous terrain. \r\n\r\nHow to play: Use the simple touch screen control pad to easily move, fight, select weapons and more. Kill enemies, utilize exploding barrels. Keep an eye out for hidden perks and weapons. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Addictive and mesmerizing maps\r\n-Efficient weapon controls and movement\r\n-Fight your way against dozens of foes\r\n-Think strategically\r\n-Interactive surroundings\r\n-Heated gun battles and ruthless snipers\r\n-Pixel style defense game\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NT1ZBD04F9C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Restaurant Fever - Cooking Food Street","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40610.14422652251114314.9d5ddd0f-623e-4d58-9e5d-a54d6ace15cb.3e9ac729-6764-4003-ad60-0f4517428a11","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61463.14422652251114314.9d5ddd0f-623e-4d58-9e5d-a54d6ace15cb.dcddea40-ddec-47e0-b639-68d300203d51","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40610.14422652251114314.9d5ddd0f-623e-4d58-9e5d-a54d6ace15cb.3e9ac729-6764-4003-ad60-0f4517428a11","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["15099SimKidsAdventureGame.RestaurantFever-CookingF_zsk4ancj3a1sw"],"ContentIds":["671991b6-7464-d81d-7ddf-3d9c993b9747","c7fbda5c-922a-524f-da59-6e7799950677"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Love burgers, fries, cooking games and restaurant games?!

As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in. We included in this game only winnable deals for all types of games: with one suit, with 2 suits and 4 suits. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly. Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.
